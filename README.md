Update iChat with your Last.fm Status
=====================================

Dan O'Donovan January 2012

Requirements
------------

Patience and BeautifulSoup (and OSX ofcourse)

Instructions
------------

Just change for your username in the script, and run from the command line:

$ python script.py

Future
------

Maybe soon I'll turn this into a daemon that will run in the background for
you, that would be nice. It would also be good to remove BeautifulSoup so that
we don't have to install any extra packages.
